The Farmer's Assistant App is a smart companion designed for plant care and farming. This application leverages IBM's cutting-edge AI and cloud services to provide users with actionable insights about plant health, farming techniques, and crop care. It combines powerful vision and language models with session-based conversational capabilities to deliver context-aware and accurate responses.

### Features
- Detect diseases using IBM Watson's Language & Vision Models by just uploading images
-  Upload documents containing plant-related information (e.g., history, care), Ask questions about the document's content using IBM Watson's Large Language Models (LLM).
- Session-Based Conversations

- Maintains session history using IBM Cloudant, Automatically appends summaries of past interactions for context-aware responses, Converts model responses into audio using IBM Text-to-Speech service.
- Utilizes IBM's Granite model for text-based analysis, Leverages Meta Llama model for robust language processing.
